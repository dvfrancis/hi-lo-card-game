| The Fontawesome logos are not centred | Replace original code with Bootstrap classes to organise the icons into rows and columns before applying text-end and text-start to achieve final position |

## Unfixed Bugs

Here is a list of bugs I was unable to fix due to circumstances beyond my control:

MENTION ABOUT BACKGOURND IMAGE ISSUE WHICH COULD NOT BE FIXED. JULIA THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE RELATED TO BOOTSTRAP. TRIED COMBINATION BACKGOURND SELECTOR, SEPARATE SELECTORS, DIFFERENT FILE PATHS, DIFFERENT FILE LOCATIONS, RECREATING THE IMAGE, CHECKING THAT EVERYTHING WAS SPELT CORRECTLY, CHECKING THAT ALL TAGS WERE CLOSED CORRECTLY - NOTHING WORKED.
