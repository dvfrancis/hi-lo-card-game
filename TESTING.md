## Accessibility

Pages were tested for accessibility using the [Wave Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org):

### index.html

![WAVE report for index.html](assets/images/holding-image.jpg)

### faq.html

![WAVE report for index.html](assets/images/holding-image.jpg)

### 404.html

The error being shown here is because of the auto-redirect setup on the page, which is part of the design:

## Performance

Each page was audited using [Google Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/), for both mobile and desktop:

### index.html

#### Mobile

#### Desktop

#### Mobile

![Mobile performance report for about.html](assets/images/holding-image.jpg)

#### Desktop

![Desktop performance report for about.html](assets/images/holding-image.jpg)

### 404.html

The lower score for accessibility here is caused by two things - the presence of the redirect (which is part of the site design), and because FontAwesome automatically adds the ``aria-hidden="true"`` class to all of its icons. This cannot be stopped and is conflicting with my own ARIA label on each social media icon.

## Bugs

Here is a list of bugs encountered while building this website. Images shown illustrate the original problem:

### Bug 1

![Fixed Bug 1](assets/images/holding-image.jpg)

| Bug | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| The Fontawesome logos are not centred | Replace original code with Bootstrap classes to organise the icons into rows and columns before applying text-end and text-start to achieve final position |

## Unfixed Bugs

Here is a list of bugs I was unable to fix due to circumstances beyond my control:

### Bug 1

![Unfixed Bug 1](assets/images/holding-image.jpg)

| Bug | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| There is a white line beneath the footer | This only occurs in Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge; the line does not appear in other browers tested. After discussing this with Code Institute's tutor support we came to the conclusion it was either a problem with that type of browser, or a strange quirk of the computer I am using |
